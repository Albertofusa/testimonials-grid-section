            "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. i've been
            loking to make a <br />
            transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
            here. I signed up for <br />
            the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I entolled
            shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br />
            weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of many life. Since
            completing the course, I've <br />
            successfully switched careers,working as a Software Engineer ar a VR
            startup".

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've <br />
            never written a line of code. Ineded <br />
            some structure from professionals <br />
            who can help me learn programming <br />
            step by step. I was encouraged to <br />
            enroll by a former student of theirs <br />
            who can only say wonderful things <br />
            about the program .The entire <br />
            curriculum and staff did not <br />
            disappoint . They were very hands-on <br />
            and I never had to wait long for <br />
            assistance. The agile team project, in <br />
            particular, was outdtanding. it look <br />
            my learning to he next level in a way <br />
            that no tutorial could ever have.in <br />
            fact, I've often referred to it durring <br />
            interviews as can example of my <br />
            developent experience. It certainly <br />
            helped me land a job as a full-stack <br />
            developer after receiving multiple <br />
            offers. 100% recommend!
